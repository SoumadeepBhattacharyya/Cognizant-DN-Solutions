## âœ… Topics Covered
- Singleton Design Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Searching Algorithms (Linear & Binary Search)
- Recursive Financial Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- All code is written in Java.
- Output screenshots are included in each respective folder.

# Week 2 â€“ PL/SQL and Java Testing (JUnit, Mockito, SLF4J)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Control Structures
- PL/SQL blocks to apply interest discounts, promote VIPs, and send loan reminders.
- âœ… Output screenshots attached.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Stored Procedures
- Procedures:
  - `ProcessMonthlyInterest`
  - `UpdateEmployeeBonus`
  - `TransferFunds`

## ðŸ”¹ 3. JUnit Testing
- Setup of Maven project with JUnit
- Usage of assertions: `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertNull`, etc.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Mockito
- Mocking and verifying external API calls.
- Used `when()`, `verify()` for test interactions.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. SLF4J Logging
- Logged warning and error messages using SLF4J + Logback.
- Output confirms log levels.

ðŸ“š Week 3 â€“ Spring Framework
This week covers the basics of setting up and using the Spring Framework in a Java application using Maven.

âœ… Exercise 1: Configuring a Basic Spring Application
Created a Maven project: LibraryManagement

Added Spring Core dependency in pom.xml

Configured applicationContext.xml to define BookService and BookRepository beans

Created Java classes in appropriate packages:

com.library.service.BookService

com.library.repository.BookRepository

Verified output using a main class: "Spring in action"

ðŸ“Ž Output: Output/1_ConfiguringSpring_Output.png

âœ… Exercise 2: Implementing Dependency Injection
Updated applicationContext.xml to inject BookRepository into BookService using setter-based DI

Modified BookService class to include a setter method

Successfully tested bean wiring and execution

ðŸ“Ž Output: Output/2_DependencyInjection_Output.png

âœ… Exercise 4: Creating and Configuring Maven Project
Configured Maven Compiler Plugin for Java 1.8

Added Spring dependencies: spring-context, spring-aop, spring-webmvc

Verified successful Maven build

ðŸ“Ž Output: Output/4_MavenProjectSetup_Output.png
